### Summarized

#### **Winchester**

**`Dating`** Boxes by Lot Numbers

1.Western Since 1928 and **`Winchester`** Since 1958

Since **1958** the lot numbers used on **`Winchester`** boxes are in the same format as used by Western since about **1928**, and repeat every twenty years. The lot number will have a letter-letter-number or letter-letter-number-number series that indicated the date. The first letter indicates the year, the second letter the month. If followed by a single digit, that equates to a single digit day; if followed by two digits, the numbers are reversed to equate with a two digit day or dingle digit day with a leading zero. Examples: **10=01**, **60=06**, **21=12**, **61=16**, **82=28**, **13=31**.
Hence the series **DA82** will equate to 28 January **1930** or **1950** or **1970** or **1990** or **2010**, depending on the box design. Additional numbers and/or letters equate to production lines, operator or inspector numbers.
